# TEST FOLDER

This folder is for testing dege cases, it shouldn't produce any errors or warnings.

To exclude it from processing, just rename it with a leading underscore (`_TEST`).

# Test Files

- [`comments-only.pb`](./comments-only.pb) — contains only comment lines
- [`empty-keys.pb`](./empty-keys.pb) — contains only keys with empty values
- [`no-header-comments.pb`](./no-header-comments.pb) — file without Header Comments Block (first line is not a comment)

# Expected Behavior

Here is an explanation of the expected results of how the app should handle the test files.
