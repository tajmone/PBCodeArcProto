<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tajmone/PBCodeArcProto" class="uri">https://github.com/tajmone/PBCodeArcProto</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Temporary prototype dev repo for a website generator for the <strong><a href="https://github.com/SicroAtGit/PureBasic-CodeArchive-Rebirth" title="Visit the &#39;PureBasic CodeArchiv Rebirth&#39; repository">PureBasic CodeArchiv Rebirth</a></strong> project. Will be destroyed once the Indexer is ready and integrated into the parent project.</p>
<p>Based on the original discussion with <a href="https://github.com/SicroAtGit" title="View @SicroAtGit&#39;s GitHub profile">@SicroAtGit</a> in <a href="https://github.com/SicroAtGit/PureBasic-CodeArchive-Rebirth/issues/5">Issue #5</a>.</p>
<p>Project organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./_assets"><code>/_assets/</code></a> — the actual <strong>HTMLPagesCreator</strong> code + HTML assets</li>
<li><a href="./_tempwork"><code>/_tempwork/</code></a> — isolated code work</li>
<li><a href="./_morgue"><code>/_morgue/</code></a> — left-over temp code</li>
</ul>
<p>the remaining folders are contents taken from the PureBasic CodeArchiv Rebirth project to test the app.</p>
<h1>License Info</h1>
<p>This is a temporary project, there isn't a single license governing it as a whole. Third party resources herein contained (wether for testing purposes or as dependencies to the code I'm writing) are bound by their specific license, so make sure to check the source file headers and/or for the presence of a license file in each subfolder.</p>
<h2>Third Party Resources</h2>
<p>This project contains code from various sources, each governed by their own license terms which can be found in the source files commente headers, or in a license files inside the folder hosting the resource(s).</p>
<h3>PureBasic CodeArchiv Resources</h3>
<p>For testing purposes, I've copied to this repository some of the resources of the <a href="https://github.com/SicroAtGit/PureBasic-CodeArchive-Rebirth" title="Visit the &#39;PureBasic CodeArchiv Rebirth&#39; repository">PureBasic CodeArchiv Rebirth</a> project — in order to test the HTML pages builder against real case scenarios.</p>
<p>Any root-level folder whose name doesn't start with an underscore is most likely to have been copied over from the <a href="https://github.com/SicroAtGit/PureBasic-CodeArchive-Rebirth" title="Visit the &#39;PureBasic CodeArchiv Rebirth&#39; repository">PureBasic CodeArchiv Rebirth</a> project (notable exceptions are the &quot;<code>ERRORS</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>TEST</code>&quot; folder which were created for testing imaginary edge cases).</p>
<p>These folders from the PureBasic CodeArchiv contain resources from various authors, each governed by its own license terms, as specified in their source files (or in their <code>CodeInfo.txt</code> file).</p>
<p>Such resources are not strictly part of this project, they are just accessory to its development and testing. This prototype project will finally result in an application which will be intergrated into the <a href="https://github.com/SicroAtGit/PureBasic-CodeArchive-Rebirth" title="Visit the &#39;PureBasic CodeArchiv Rebirth&#39; repository">PureBasic CodeArchiv Rebirth</a> project for the scope of indexing the resources therein contained.

<p>So any source file in this project bearing a <code>by Tristano Ajmone</code> in its source is to be considered MIT licensed, unless another license is expressily specified.</p>
<p>At the current stage it's impossible for me to determine if MIT will be the final license for this project — ultimately, the final license will depend on the licenses of third party resources employed. As third party resources are added to the project, their license is also added. So, the current license terms of my code contributions might be subject to change if I end up using third party code which is MIT incompatible.</p>
<p>Because this is an experimental prototype, I didn't initally put too much emphasis on licensing; but as my dear collaborator @SicroAtGit has pointed out, it's time for me to put order in this project's licensing terms since it's starting to include more third party resource and opening up to third party contributions too.</p>
<p>My final goal is to release under a permissive license any code and/resources I'll have contributed toward creating an application for building a website for the <a href="https://github.com/SicroAtGit/PureBasic-CodeArchive-Rebirth" title="Visit the &#39;PureBasic CodeArchiv Rebirth&#39; repository">PureBasic CodeArchiv Rebirth</a> project. I want to share it, and that other might reuse it too.</p>
<p>You're free to clone this project, edit it, test and experiment with it, but if you wish to reuse or distribute any parts of it, please check the license of every single resource and contact their authors if in doubt.</p>
