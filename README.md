# PBCodeArcProto

    Pre-alpha drafting stage

- https://github.com/tajmone/PBCodeArcProto

Temporary prototype dev repo for a website generator for the __[PureBasic CodeArchiv Rebirth]__ project. Will be destroyed once the Indexer is ready and integrated into the parent project.

Based on the original discussion with [@SicroAtGit] in [Issue #5].

Project organization:

- [`/_assets/`](./_assets) — the actual __HTMLPagesCreator__ code + HTML assets
- [`/_tempwork/`](./_tempwork) — isolated code work

the remaining folders are contents taken from the PureBasic CodeArchiv Rebirth project to test the app.
