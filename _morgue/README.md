# The Morgue

This folder is the place where all temporary code gets stocked once it has served its purpose. Mainly, it's code that was used to build some features in isolated files before integration into the main app.

They are kept here for a while as they might still be useful references. But sooner or later they will inevitably be erased and buries. May these snippets RIP.
