# The Morgue

This folder is the place where all temporary code and docs get stocked once they've served its purpose. Mainly, it's material that was used to build some features in isolated files before integration into the main app.

They are kept here for a while as they might still be useful references. But sooner or later they will inevitably be erased and buried. May these snippets RIP.


# Files/Corpses List

- [`BuildProjectTree.pb`](./BuildProjectTree.pb) — project-scanner prototype.
- [`IndexerPrototype.pb`](./IndexerPrototype.pb) — HTML pages creator prototype.
- [`comments_parser.pbi`](./comments_parser.pbi) — comments parser prototype.
- [`OLD__HTMLPagesCreator.md`](./OLD__HTMLPagesCreator.md) — the old `/_assets/README.md`, before modularization started.
