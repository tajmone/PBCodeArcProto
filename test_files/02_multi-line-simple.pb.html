Carry on value: the dot indicates this line extends the value of the current key being parsed.<br /><br />Every line is trimmed of leading and traling whitespace, and joined with the previous line -- a space separator is added between the joined lines, unless the previous line was empy.<br /><br />Therefore, this line and the next one will be merged a single paragraph.<br /><br />Empty lines are rendered as a double EOL sequence, to separate paragraphs.<br /><br />Because leading spaces are ignored, even if this line is indentented by 2 spaces more than the rest, in the final string should be just a plain paragraph.</td></tr><tr><td>carry-on 2:</td><td>1st line. 2nd line (carry on). 3rd line (carry on).</td></tr><tr><td>OS:</td><td>Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Value starting on carry-on:</td><td>In this key-value pair the value string starts on the carry-on lines. Usually this is done to preserve text wrapping in long descriptions, or to make the text more readable.<br /><br />The parser will not add an empty line at the start of this value.</td></tr><tr><td>English-Forum:</td><td><a href="http://www.purebasic.fr/english/viewtopic.php?p=404657#p404657">http://www.purebasic.fr/english/viewtopic.php?p=404657#p404657</a></td></tr><tr><td>French-Forum:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>German-Forum:</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
