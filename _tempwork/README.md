# Temporary Dev Folder

This folder contains parts of code and template work/test files that are being developed independently before insertion into the main app.

# Folder Structure

- [`/test_files/`](./test_files) — PB source files with header-blocks designed to test comments parsing and edge cases.
- [`/template/`](./template) — tests for building the final HTML5 template.

- [`erase-logs.bat`](./erase-logs.bat) — Delets all log files.


# Usage and Testing

Currently there aren't any more prototypes for testing here.
